## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Vite, React, Typescript, bootstrap,  react-router-dom

Created a simple react-ts using vite to create project folder app that uses these dependencies (BOOTSTRAP, react-router-dom, Typescript) for styling, routing and checking of our application.

Use context for implementing state management that will handle crud operations and also custom hooks for local storage.

## Optimizations

- Organize folder structure.
- Created utility function for formatting.
- Context for state management
- Custom Hooks for local storage implementation.

## Lessons Learned:

- Using vite to create a project.
- Implementation of typescript in react.
- Advance folder structure.
- Use context for state management
